This is the MHackers Quant Team Project from W24.

This project implements an RSI trading strategy to buy or sell the given stock at certain thresholds.

To run this:
Run python main.py to run the default ticker, AAPL.
Run python main.py NVDA to run whatever stock you would like. Replace NVDA with whatever ticker you would like to run.

The current state of this project runs over one year, 2022. This can be changed by going into algorithm.py lines 11 and 12 and changing the dates to whatever you would like.

test.py is not run in this project, but it was used to by the team to test the packages that were used.
